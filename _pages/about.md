Hey, my name is Niklas. I am a PhD Candidate at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy in Bochum, Germany. I am interested in Machine Learning, Software Security, and Web Development.

I am also the Co-Founder and Maintainer of [everlense](https://www.everlense.de), which is a web application for sharing wedding pictures (with lots of cool features).

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Software Engineer for the German Startup [clockin](https://www.clockin.de), and earned a masters degree in Intelligent Systems from Bielefeld University.
