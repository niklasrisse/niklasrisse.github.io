Hey, my name is Niklas Risse. I am a PhD Candidate at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy in Bochum, Germany. My research interests cover Machine Learning, Software Security and everything in-between.

I am also a Co-Founder of [https://www.everlense.de](everlense.de), a photo app for wedding pictures.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Software Engineer for the German Startup [https://www.clockin.de](clockin), and earned a masters degree in Intelligent Systems from Bielefeld University.
